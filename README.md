## Intro

So you're running a conference, and you want to have a place for your attendees to chat. Hooray! Adding these channels can help attendees mingle and meet and plan out-of-conference activities.

Slack is a popular choice for conference chat, and this guide is a checklist of suggestions to make your life as an organizer as painless as possible, and give your attendees the best experience. Let's begin!

## Pre-conference, before you invite attendees

. Decide if slack _is_ the right choice for you. Yes, it's popular, but there are lots of open source tools that perform a similar function, and slack/chat fatigue is real. Make sure that your team is ready to take on the commitment of an online community when you open up your conference slack.
2. Make sure your Code of Conduct (which you have, because you're a cool conference organizer) has language that includes online spaces.
3. In your new slack, create some channels you want available for all attendees. #intro, #slack-tips, and #codeofconduct are good starting points!
4. Rename your #general channel to #announcements. https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201654073-Rename-a-channel
5. Create a new channel called #general or #commons to give your attendees space to talk.
6. In your workspace settings (https://{your workspace url}.slack.com/admin/settings), add your new channels to "Default Channels"
7. In your workspace settings (https://{your workspace url}.slack.com/admin/settings), under Email Display turn "Display email addresses" off.
8. In your workspace permissions (https://{your workspace url}.slack.com/admin/settings#permissions), under "Messaging" change "People who can use @channel and @here:" to "Workspace Owners and Admins Only"
9. In your workspace permissions (https://{your workspace url}.slack.com/admin/settings#permissions), under "Messaging" change "People who can post to #general:" to "Workspace Owners and Admins Only"
10. In your workspace permissions (https://{your workspace url}.slack.com/admin/settings#permissions), under "Messaging" change "People who can use @everyone:" to "Workspace Owners and Admins Only"
11. In your workspace app permissions (https://{your workspace url}.slack.com/apps/manage/permissions), turn "Approved Apps" to "On"
12. Add the twitter integration (https://{your workspace url}.slack.com/apps/A0F7XDW93-twitter) for your conference's twitter account to your #announcements channel. Now you only need to post announcements in one place! Note: the account you authenticate the integration with does not need to be the account you want to mirror.
